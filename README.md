# FOCUS-Backend
Backend code for FOCUS, a masterâ€™s group project. This Django-based app uses machine learning to process real-time eye-tracking data, extracting metrics like blinks, fixations, and pupil dilation. It provides APIs for user management, eye data analysis, and session tracking, supporting a frontend for visualising productivity and eye strain.
